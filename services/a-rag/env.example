# The base path for all API version 1 endpoints.
API_V1_STR="/api/v1"


# --- Security & JWT Configuration ---
# A long, random, and secret string used for signing JWTs.
# Generate a new one for your actual .env file.
# You can use: openssl rand -hex 32

# --- Model Configuration ---
# The path to the GGUF model file, RELATIVE TO THE `volumes/` directory.
# In a Docker setup, this path will be mounted inside the container.
# The path to the GGUF model file, RELATIVE TO THE MONOREPO ROOT.
MODEL_PATH="model_data/mistral-7b-instruct-v0.2.Q4_K_M.gguf"

# --- Database Configuration ---
# The connection string for the database.
# For local development with SQLite, this points to a file in the service's root.
# For production Docker, this would be changed to point to a PostgreSQL/MySQL service, e.g.:
